    <h2>Description</h2>

        <h3>
            Mochi dates back over 1,000 years to the Heian period (794–1185), originally used in Shinto rituals and offered to the gods for good fortune.<br>
            It became associated with the New Year (Oshōgatsu) and is still a staple in Japanese holiday celebrations. Mochi represents longevity and strength, and making it is as much a communal tradition as it is a culinary one — particularly through the ceremony of mochitsuki (pounding mochi).

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>
            Traditional mochi uses only a few pure ingredients:

            <ul>

                <li>
                Glutinous rice (Mochigome) – a special short-grain rice that becomes sticky when cooked
                </li>

                <li>
                Water
                </li>

                <li>
                (Optional) Sugar, cornstarch, or fillings like: <br>

                Anko (sweet red bean paste)<br>

                Kinako (roasted soybean flour)<br>

                Fruit (like strawberries)<br>

                Note: Store-bought “mochi flour” (Shiratamako or Mochiko) is often used for modern, quick versions.
                </li>

            </ul>

<h2>How to Prepare Traditional Mochi (with Steamed Rice)</h2>

<h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
        Step 1: Soak and Steam the Rice
            <ol>
                <li>
                Rinse glutinous rice until water runs clear.
                </li>

                <li>
                Soak it in water for at least 8 hours or overnight.
                </li>

                <li>
                Steam the rice (not boil!) for 30–40 minutes until soft and sticky.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>


        <li>
        Step 2: Pound the Rice (Mochitsuki)
            <ol>
                <li>
                Transfer hot rice to a large wooden or stone mortar (usu).
                </li>

                <li>
                Use a heavy wooden mallet (kine) to pound the rice.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                One person wets and turns the rice. Another person pounds in a rhythm.

                </li>

                <li>
                Continue pounding until the rice turns into a smooth, stretchy dough.

                </li>
                This is the heart of traditional mochi — a labor of love and teamwork.

            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
        Step 3: Shape the Mochi
            <ol>

                <li>
                Dust hands and surface with cornstarch or potato starch to prevent sticking.
                </li>

                <li>
                Pinch off small balls and shape while still warm.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                You can flatten and fill with anko or other fillings if desired.
                </li>
         
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
