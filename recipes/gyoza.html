<h2>Description</h2>
<h3>
    Gyoza was originated from Chinese jiaozi. It was introduced to Japan during the early 20th century, but gained major popularity after World War II, when Japanese soldiers returned home with a taste for the Chinese dumplings they encountered in Manchuria. <br>

The Japanese adapted the original recipe — making the wrappers thinner, the fillings more garlicky, and the cooking method uniquely Japanese with the famous "yaki-gyoza" (pan-fried style).

<h2>How to Prepare Gyoza</h2>

<h3>

    <ol>
        
        <li>
        Step 1: Prepare the Filling

            <ol>
                <li>
                Finely chop cabbage and sprinkle with salt. Let sit 10–15 minutes, then squeeze out excess moisture.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                Mix with ground pork, garlic, ginger, chives, soy sauce, sake, sesame oil, and pepper.<br>
                </li>
                <li>
                Stir until the mixture becomes sticky — this binds everything together.
                </li>             

            </ol>
        </li>

       <li>
        Step 2: Wrap the Gyoza

            <ol>
                <li>
                Place a small spoonful of filling in the center of a wrapper.
                </li>
                <li>
                Wet the edge of the wrapper with water.
                </li>
                <li>
                Fold in half and pleat the top edge while sealing the bottom — traditional gyoza have 5 pleats on one side.
                </li>   
                Tip: Don’t overfill, and press firmly to seal — no leaks allowed!          

            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
        Step 3: Pan-Fry the Gyoza (Yaki-Gyoza)

            <ol>
                <li>
                Heat a bit of oil in a non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
                </li>
                <li>
                Add gyoza flat-side down in a circular pattern.
                </li>
                <li>
                Cook for 2–3 minutes until the bottoms are golden brown.
                </li>   

            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
        Step 4: Steam

            <ol>
                <li>
                Add about 1/4 cup of water to the pan.
                </li>
                <li>
                Immediately cover with a lid to trap steam.
                </li>
                <li>
                Steam for about 4–5 minutes until water evaporates and the tops are cooked through.
                </li>   

            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
        Step 5: Crisp the Bottom Again

            <ol>
                <li>
                Once water is gone, uncover and cook for another 30–60 seconds to re-crisp the bottoms.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <li>
        Step 6: Serve
            <ol>
                <li>
                Flip carefully onto a plate, browned side up and serve with dipping sauce!
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>


    </ol>
